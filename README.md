<h1>gridClasses</h1>

<p>A jQuery plugin that adds classes to items floated in a grid style. The following classes are added: topRow, bottomRow, firstInRow, lastInRow (the class names themselves may be altered). Why not :nth-child() selectors? This plug-in re-configures on window re-size to accommodate flexible grid layouts.</p>

<h2>SAMPLE USAGE</h2>

<p><code>$(<em>grid-item</em>).gridClasses();</code></p>
